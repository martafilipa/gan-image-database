# Generative Image Database
Database for images obtained with some GAN-based solution. 


## Images Obtained with GANs
The images available were obtained using the following solutions: 
- [High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression](https://hific.github.io/)
- [ESRGAN: Enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial networks](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN)
- [Image and Video Restoration and Compression Artefact Removal Using a NoGAN Approach](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3394171.3414451)

More details regarding the conditions under which these images were obtained are provided in [images/](/images).

## Subjective Assessment Results 
A subjective quality assessment was done with the images presented in [images/](/images). This assessment was a 2-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) and the results obtained are presented in [results/](/results). 

## Objective quality metric results
In [results/](/results) is also provided the scores of available images on some objective quality metrics.
